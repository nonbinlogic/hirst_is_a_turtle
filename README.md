# Damien Hirst Dot Art with Python Turtle

This project mimics Damien Hirst's Colour Space (most people just call them dots) paintings using Python's turtle graphics module. When people say "a five-year-old could do that" when critiquing modern art, I say, "a turtle could do that!"

## Description

This project uses Python's turtle graphics module to draw a grid of colorful dots, similar to Damien Hirst's dot paintings.

## Features

- Generates a grid of dots using the turtle graphics module.
- Adjustable parameters for dot size, spacing, and grid dimensions.
- A playful commentary on modern art using a simple Python script.
